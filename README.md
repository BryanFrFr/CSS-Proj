This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Note

If the API key used to fetch data in my-app/MRT/api/route.js does not work, please refer to .env.local for the alternative keys. If both alternative keys and the original key cannot be used to fetch data from LTA Datamall, please user your own API key provided by LTA Datamall.

.env.local.example contains an example of the API keys used in each of the router handlers. They are not the actual keys and should not be used to fetch data from LTA Datamall. 

## Getting Started

First, install the reqiured packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.    

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
